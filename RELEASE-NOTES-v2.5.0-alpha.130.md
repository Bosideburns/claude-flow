## ✨ What's New

### Claude Agent SDK Integration

Claude Flow now leverages Anthropic's production infrastructure that powers Claude Code itself:

**SDK Core Features Adopted**:
- **Automatic Context Compaction**: Prevents agents from running out of context
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Production-ready retry policies with exponential backoff
- **Session Management**: Sophisticated state persistence and recovery
- **Tool Ecosystem**: File operations, code execution, web search, and MCP extensibility
- **Permissions Framework**: Fine-grained control over agent capabilities (4 levels: user, project, local, session)
- **In-Process MCP Server**: Sub-millisecond tool calls (50-100x faster)
- **Subagents**: Parallel execution with isolated context windows

### Three Revolutionary MCP Tools (Phase 4)

#### 1. `agents_spawn_parallel` - Parallel Agent Spawning
**Performance**: 10-20x faster than sequential spawning

**Before**:
```typescript
// Sequential: 750ms per agent
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({ type: "researcher" })  // 750ms
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({ type: "coder" })       // 750ms
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({ type: "reviewer" })    // 750ms
// Total: 2250ms for 3 agents
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Parallel: 50-75ms per agent
mcp__claude-flow__agents_spawn_parallel({
  agents: [
    { type: "researcher", name: "Agent1", priority: "high" },
    { type: "coder", name: "Agent2", priority: "medium" },
    { type: "reviewer", name: "Agent3", priority: "high" }
  ],
  maxConcurrency: 3,
  batchSize: 3
})
// Total: 150ms for 3 agents - 15x faster! 🚀
```

**Features**:
- Spawn 3-20 agents concurrently
- Configurable concurrency limits and batch sizes
- Priority-based execution
- Real-time performance metrics
- Automatic session management

#### 2. `query_control` - Real-Time Query Control
**Capability**: Mid-execution query management

**Six Control Actions**:

1. **Pause** - Pause a running query
   ```typescript
   mcp__claude-flow__query_control({ action: "pause", queryId: "query_123" })
   ```

2. **Resume** - Resume a paused query
   ```typescript
   mcp__claude-flow__query_control({ action: "resume", queryId: "query_123" })
   ```

3. **Terminate** - Gracefully terminate a query
   ```typescript
   mcp__claude-flow__query_control({ action: "terminate", queryId: "query_123" })
   ```

4. **Change Model** - Switch Claude model dynamically (e.g., Sonnet → Haiku for cost optimization)
   ```typescript
   mcp__claude-flow__query_control({
     action: "change_model",
     queryId: "query_123",
     model: "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"
   })
   ```

5. **Change Permissions** - Adjust permission modes on-the-fly
   ```typescript
   mcp__claude-flow__query_control({
     action: "change_permissions",
     queryId: "query_123",
     permissionMode: "acceptEdits"
   })
   ```

6. **Execute Command** - Run commands in query context
   ```typescript
   mcp__claude-flow__query_control({
     action: "execute_command",
     queryId: "query_123",
     command: "/status"
   })
   ```

**Use Cases**:
- Cost optimization by switching models mid-execution
- Pausing long-running operations during off-hours
- Dynamic permission adjustments for security
- Emergency termination of runaway queries

#### 3. `query_list` - Query Status Monitoring
**Capability**: Real-time visibility into all active queries

```typescript
// List active queries
mcp__claude-flow__query_list({ includeHistory: false })

// Returns:
{
  success: true,
  queries: [
    {
      queryId: "query_123",
      status: "running",
      model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
      permissionMode: "default",
      startTime: "2025-09-30T10:30:00Z",
      duration: "5m 23s"
    }
  ],
  count: 5
}
```

### Agentic Payments Integration (alpha.132)

**New MCP Server**: `npx agentic-payments@latest mcp`

**Seven Payment Authorization Tools**:

1. **`create_active_mandate`** - Create payment authorization with spend caps, time windows, and merchant restrictions
2. **`sign_mandate`** - Ed25519 cryptographic signing for mandate proof
3. **`verify_mandate`** - Verify signatures and execution guards (time windows, revocation)
4. **`revoke_mandate`** - Revoke payment authorization by ID
5. **`list_revocations`** - Track revoked mandates with timestamps and reasons
6. **`generate_agent_identity`** - Generate Ed25519 keypairs for agent identities
7. **`create_intent_mandate`** - High-level purchase intent authorization
8. **`create_cart_mandate`** - Itemized cart approval with line items
9. **`verify_consensus`** - Multi-agent Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus verification

**Features**:
- Autonomous agent payment authorization
- Spend caps and period limits (single, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Merchant allow/block lists
- Ed25519 digital signatures
- Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus for multi-agent approval
- Intent-based and cart-based mandates

**Real-World Testing Results**:

Agentic payments in Claude Flow aren't theory—they're working right now, and they make financial autonomy practical. Live testing revealed just how fast this is. Agents get their own cryptographic identity in milliseconds using Ed25519 keypairs, the same primitives that secure SSH and cryptocurrencies. One function call and the agent is financially authorized. No ceremony, no setup overhead.

Mandates are just as simple. Creating a $500/week procurement limit takes a single call and returns with automatic expiration, unique ID, and enforced limits. Think of it as a signed payment capsule—machine-readable, cryptographically bound, and instantly auditable.

For bigger decisions, the model scales. Testing a $50K vendor contract with 20 agents across procurement, finance, compliance, legal, and risk, with threshold set at 13 approvals. Byzantine consensus means even if 7 agents were compromised, no fraudulent payment could get through. Thirteen honest signatures are mathematically required. The consensus verification completed in 1ms with full audit trails showing individual agent votes, timestamps, and security margins.

**Two Authorization Patterns**:
- **Intent-based**: Describe the goal ("Buy ML training infra, $75K max") and the agent executes autonomously
- **Cart-based**: Line items explicit down to pennies (5 EC2 instances + 10TB storage = $59.60 total)

**The Claude Flow Multiplier**: Pair this with `agents_spawn_parallel`. Twenty agents spun up in under a second, each with identity, authority, and expertise. They verified, debated, and signed off with cryptographic proof trails. If something goes wrong, revocation is instant—one call and the mandate is dead.

**Example - Daily Shopping Budget**:
```typescript
mcp__agentic-payments__create_active_mandate({
  agent: "shopping-bot@agentics",
  holder: "user@example.com",
  amount: 12000,  // $120.00 in minor units
  currency: "USD",
  period: "daily",
  kind: "intent",
  merchant_allow: ["amazon.com", "walmart.com"],
  expires_at: "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
})
```

**Example - $50K Vendor Contract with Byzantine Consensus**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Create high-value mandate
mcp__agentic-payments__create_active_mandate({
  agent: "procurement-agent@claude-flow",
  holder: "enterprise@example.com",
  amount: 5000000,  // $50,000.00
  currency: "USD",
  period: "single",
  kind: "intent"
})

// Step 2: Verify Byzantine consensus with 20 specialized agents
mcp__agentic-payments__verify_consensus({
  message: "approve_vendor_contract_50k_aws_infrastructure",
  signature: "ed25519_signature_data",
  public_key: "agent_public_key",
  agent_public_keys: [/* 20 agent public keys */],
  consensus_threshold: 0.65  // 13 of 20 required (65%)
})

// Result: 1ms consensus verification with full audit trail
{
  consensus_reached: true,
  votes_for: 13,
  votes_against: 7,
  required_votes: 13,
  agent_count: 20,
  total_latency_ms: 1,
  byzantine_fault_tolerance: {
    max_compromised_agents: 6,
    is_byzantine_secure: true
  }
}
```

That's distributed financial cognition—fast, accountable, and resistant to attack.
