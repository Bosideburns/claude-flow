**Query:** What is Node.js?
**Date:** 2025-09-29T13:26:24.360Z

## Answer

Node.js is an **open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment** that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, primarily for building fast, scalable server-side and networking applications[2][3][4][5]. It is **not a programming language or a framework**, but rather an environment that enables JavaScript to be used for backend development.

**Key characteristics and architecture:**

- **Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine:** Node.js uses the same engine as Google Chrome to compile JavaScript into efficient machine code, resulting in high performance[2][3][4][5].
- **Asynchronous, event-driven, non-blocking I/O:** Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking the main thread, making it highly efficient for I/O-intensive tasks such as web servers, APIs, real-time applications, and streaming services[1][2][3][4][5].
- **Single-threaded with event loop:** While Node.js operates on a single thread, it can handle thousands of simultaneous connections by offloading I/O operations and using callbacks, promises, or async/await for asynchronous programming[1][3][4].
- **Rich standard library and npm ecosystem:** Node.js provides built-in modules for networking, file system access, cryptography, and more. Its package manager, npm, offers over a million reusable packages for rapid development[2][4][5].
- **Cross-platform:** Node.js runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems, making it versatile for various deployment environments[2][3][4].

**Typical use cases:**

- **Web servers and APIs:** Node.js is widely used to build scalable web servers and RESTful APIs[2][3][4][5].
- **Real-time applications:** Its event-driven model is ideal for chat apps, online gaming, live collaboration tools, and other real-time systems[2][4][5].
- **Streaming and data-intensive applications:** Node.js efficiently handles streaming data and large numbers of concurrent connections, making it suitable for video streaming and IoT[2][4][5].
- **Command-line tools and automation:** Developers use Node.js to create CLI tools and scripts for automating tasks[2][4].
- **Microservices and serverless architectures:** Node.js is often chosen for building microservices and deploying serverless functions due to its lightweight and fast startup[4].

**Why Node.js matters:**

- **JavaScript everywhere:** Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side code, streamlining development and reducing context switching[2][3][4][5].
- **Scalability and performance:** Its non-blocking architecture allows efficient handling of high-traffic applications and real-time data, making it popular among companies like Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn, Uber, and NASA[2][4][5].
- **Large, active community:** Node.js benefits from a vibrant open-source community, extensive documentation, and a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks[2][4][5].

**Example: Simple HTTP server in Node.js**
```javascript
const { createServer } = require('node:http');
const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```
This code creates a basic web server that responds with "Hello World" to every request[1][3].

**In summary:**  
Node.js is a powerful, efficient, and widely adopted runtime environment that brings JavaScript to the server side, enabling the development of scalable, high-performance applications across a variety of domains[2][3][4][5].

### 1. Node.js

**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js

**Node.js** is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.

Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.... ## History

Node.js was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about 13 years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.

Dahl criticized the limited capability of Apache HTTP Server to handle many (10,000+) concurrent connections, as well as the dominant programming paradigm of sequential programming, in which applications could block entire processes or cause the creation of multiple execution stacks for simultaneous connections.

Dahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009. Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.

In January 2010, a package manager was introduced for the Node.js environment called npm. The package manager allows programmers to publish and share Node.js packages, along with the accompanying source code, and is designed to simplify the installation, update and uninstallation of packages.

In June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js. The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011.

In January 2012, Dahl yielded management of the project to npm creator Isaac Schlueter. In January 2014, Schlueter announced that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.

In December 2014, Fedor Indutny created io.js, a fork of Node.js created because of dissatisfaction with Joyent's governance as an open-governance alternative with a separate technical committee. The goal was to enable a structure that would be more receptive to community input, including the updating of io.js with the latest Google V8 JavaScript engine releases, diverging from Node.js's approach at that time.

The Node.js Foundation, formed to reconcile Node.js and io.js under a unified banner, was announced in February 2015. The merger was realized in September 2015 with Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 combining into Node v4.0. This merge brought V8 ES6 features into Node.js and started a long-term support release cycle. By 2016, the io.js website recommended returning to Node.js and announced no further io.js releases, effectively ending the fork and solidifying the merger's success.

In 2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation.... ### Branding

The Node.js logo features a green hexagon with overlapping bands to represent the cross-platform nature of the runtime. The Rocket Turtle was chosen as the official Node.js mascot in February 2024 following a design contest.... ## Overview

Node.js allows the creation of web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of "modules" that handle various core functionalities. Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams and other core functions. Node.js's modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.

JavaScript is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS languages are available. As a result, Node.js applications can be written in CoffeeScript, Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and others.

Node.js is primarily used to build network programs such as web servers. The most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently and use callbacks to signal completion or failure).

Node.js is officially supported by Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 (and later), with Tier 2 support for SmartOS and IBM AIX and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and LTS versions are available for IBM i (AS/400). The source code may also be built on similar operating systems that are not officially supported, such as NonStop OS and Unix servers.... ### Platform architecture

Node.js enables development of fast web servers in JavaScript using event-driven programming. Developers can create scalable servers without using threading by using a simplified model that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task. Node.js connects the ease of a scripting language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming.

Node.js was built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine since it was open-sourced under the BSD license, and it contains comprehensive support for fundamental protocols such as HTTP, DNS and TCP. JavaScript's existing popularity made Node.js accessible to the web-development community.

### Industry support

There are thousands of open-source libraries for Node.js, most of which are hosted on the npm website. Multiple developer conferences and events are held that support the Node.js community, including NodeConf, Node Interactive, and Node Summit, as well as a number of regional events.

The open-source community has developed web frameworks to accelerate the development of applications. Such frameworks include Express.js, Socket.IO, Sails.js, Next.js and Meteor. Various packages have also been created for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments such as Microsoft .NET.

Modern desktop IDEs provide editing and debugging features specifically for Node.js applications. Such IDEs include Atom, Brackets, JetBrains WebStorm, Microsoft Visual Studio (with Node.js Tools for Visual Studio, or TypeScript with Node definitions), NetBeans, Nodeclipse Enide Studio (Eclipse-based) and Visual Studio Code. Some online IDEs also support Node.js, such as Codeanywhere, Eclipse Che, Cloud9 IDE and the visual flow editor in Node-RED.

Node.js is supported across a number of cloud-hosting platforms such as Jelastic, Google Cloud Platform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure Web Apps and Joyent.... ## Project governance

In 2015, various branches of the greater Node.js community began working under the vendor-neutral Node.js Foundation. The stated purpose of the organization "is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of Node.js and other related modules through an open governance model that encourages participation, technical contribution, and a framework for long-term stewardship by an ecosystem invested in Node.js' success."

The Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of the Node.js Foundation. The TSC is responsible for the core Node.js repo as well as dependent and adjacent projects. Generally the TSC delegates the administration of these projects to working groups or committees. The LTS group that manages long term supported releases is one such group. Other current groups include Website, Streams, Build, Diagnostics, i18n, Evangelism, Docker, Addon API, Benchmarking, Post-mortem, Intl, Documentation, and Testing.

In August 2017, a third of the TSC members resigned due to a dispute related to the project's code of conduct.

**URL:** https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs

# Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking. In addition, libraries in Node.js are generally written using non-blocking paradigms. Accordingly, blocking behavior is the exception rather than the norm in Node.js.

When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.

This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.

Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.... ## An Example Node.js Application

The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:

JavaScript

```

const { createServer } = require('node:http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';

const port = 3000;

const server = createServer((req, res) => {

res.statusCode = 200;

res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');

res.end('Hello World');

});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {

console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);

});

```

To run this snippet, save it as a

`server.js` file and run

`node server.js` in your terminal.

If you use mjs version of the code, you should save it as a

`server.mjs` file and run

`node server.mjs` in your terminal.

This code first includes the Node.js

`http` module.

Node.js has a fantastic standard library, including first-class support for networking.

The

`createServer()` method of

`http` creates a new HTTP server and returns it.

The server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.

Whenever a new request is received, the

`request` event is called, providing two objects: a request (an

`http.IncomingMessage` object) and a response (an

`http.ServerResponse` object).

Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.

The first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.

The second is used to return data to the caller.

In this case with:

JavaScript

```

res.statusCode = 200;

```

we set the

`statusCode` property to

`200`, to indicate a successful response.

We set the

`Content-Type` header:

JavaScript

```

res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');

```

and we close the response, adding the content as an argument to

`end()`:

JavaScript

```

res.end('Hello World\n');

```

If you haven't already done so, download Node.js.

### 3. Node.js Overview: What is Node.js and Why It Matters

**URL:** https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/what-is-nodejs

If we talk about any application then the part with which the user is interacting is basically the frontend of our website whereas there are many things which happen in the background or in the backend of our website. Basically there are three parts of any application, one is Frontend with which the users are interacting, then comes to the backend server and backend database. For backend servers we can use NodeJS, Java, Python, etc. and for backend databases we use relational or non-relational databases.

Whenever a client requests something from the client side of the application what happens is , the request is first sent to the server and then in that server some processing or calculations goes on for the validation of the client side request and after doing all such validation a response is sent to the client side. Basically for doing all such calculations and processing , this NodeJs framework of JavaScript is used.

For running our web applications outside the client’s browser , NodeJS is basically used as an open-source and cross platform JavaScript runtime environment.For running the server side applications we use this.For building the I/O intensive applications like video streaming sites ,online chatting applications and many other applications , it is used. Many established tech giant companies and newly created start-ups are using NodeJs framework in their company.

In 2009, NodeJs was developed by a guy called Ryan Dahla and the current version of NodeJs is v16.9.0.... ## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser. Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009, and its latest iteration, version 15.14, was released in April 2021. Developers use Node.js to create server-side web applications, and it is perfect for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.

Relevant Read: What is NodeJS?

Now that we know what is Node, let's look at why it is so prevalent in web development.

## How Node.js Works

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, which compiles JavaScript into efficient machine code. Node.js operates on a single-threaded event-driven architecture, utilizing an event loop to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking.

When a client sends a request to a Node.js server, the request is added to an event queue. The event loop continuously checks this queue and processes each request. If a request involves an I/O operation, Node.js offloads it to the system kernel, which handles it asynchronously. Once the I/O operation is complete, the kernel notifies Node.js, executing the corresponding callback function.

This non-blocking I/O and event-driven model allows Node.js to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently, making it ideal for building scalable, high-performance network applications.... ## Why Do We Use NodeJs?

There are many reasons for which we prefer using NodeJs for the server side of our application, some of them are discussed in the following:

- NodeJs is built on Google Chrome’s V8 engine, and for this reason its execution time is very fast and it runs very quickly.

- There are more than 50,000 bundles available in the Node Package Manager and for that reason developers can import any of the packages any time according to their needed functionality for which a lot of time is saved.

- As NodeJs do not need to wait for an API to return data , so for building real time and data intensive web applications, it is very useful. It is totally asynchronous in nature that means it is totally non-blocking.

- The loading time for an audio or video is reduced by NodeJs because there is better synchronization of the code between the client and server for having the same code base.

- As NodeJs is open-source and it is nothing but a JavaScript framework , so for the developers who are already used to JavaScript, for them starting developing their projects with NodeJs is very easy.... ## Is Node.js a Programming Language?

Node.js is not a programming language; it is a runtime environment allowing you to execute JavaScript code on the server side, outside a web browser. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, Node.js compiles JavaScript into machine code for efficient execution. It extends JavaScript capabilities by providing additional features and libraries for server-side development, such as file system access, network communication, and asynchronous I/O operations.

While JavaScript is the programming language used with Node.js, the runtime environment provides the tools and frameworks to build scalable and high-performance server applications. Node.js’s non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for real-time applications, web servers, APIs, and more. In summary, Node.js is a robust environment that leverages JavaScript to enable server-side programming, but it is not a programming language.

## Node.js Architecture

Now that we established what is Node, let’s dig into its architecture. Node.js operates on a single-thread, allowing it to handle thousands of simultaneous event loops. Here’s a diagram, provided by Sinform.com, that best illustrates Node.js architecture.... ## Parts of Node.js

Fig: Parts of Node.js

Now, let's go through each part of Node.js to get a better understanding of the server-side platform as a whole.

### Modules

Modules are like JavaScript libraries that can be used in a Node.js application to include a set of functions. In order to include a module in a Node.js application, use the require() function with the parenthesis containing the name of the module.

Fig: Include a module in Node.js

Node.js has many modules that provide the basic functionality needed for a web application. Some of them are mentioned in this table:

Fig: Node.js modules table

### Console

The console is a module that provides a method for debugging that is similar to the basic JavaScript console provided by internet browsers. It prints messages to stdout and stderr.

Fig: Node.js console

### Cluster

Node.js is built-on on the concept of single-threaded programming. Cluster is a module that allows multi-threading by creating child processes that share the same server port and run simultaneously.

A cluster can be added to an application in the following way:

Fig: Add cluster in Node.js

### Global

Global objects in Node.js are available in all modules. These objects are functions, modules, strings, etc. Some Node.js global objects are mentioned in the table below:

Fig: Global objects table... ## Applications of Node.js

Node.js is a versatile runtime environment widely used for building various applications due to its efficiency and scalability. Here are some typical applications of Node.js:

- Web Servers: Node.js is ideal for building fast and scalable web servers that handle numerous simultaneous connections with high throughput.

- Real-Time Applications: It excels in real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming, and live collaboration tools, where real-time data updates are crucial.

- APIs and Microservices: Node.js is commonly used to create RESTful APIs and microservices, facilitating communication between services in a distributed architecture.

- Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Node.js serves and handles the backend logic for single-page applications, enhancing user experience with smooth, dynamic content updates.

- Streaming Applications: Its asynchronous nature makes Node.js suitable for data streaming applications, such as video streaming services or real-time data processing.

- Command-Line Tools: Developers use Node.js to create command-line tools and scripts that automate various tasks, leveraging its rich ecosystem of packages.

## Who Uses NodeJs?

Well in 2025, there are 15+ popular companies who are using NodeJs .

Companies like NASA, Trello, Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn, Walmart, Uber, Twitter, Yahoo, eBay, GoDaddy etc are using NodeJs.... ## NPM: Node Package Manager

NPM is a popular Node.js package library and the jewel in the crown of the Node.js community. It has millions of downloadable libraries, organized according to specific requirements, and is the largest software registry in the world. NPM is free. These libraries are growing fast to this very day, and they strengthen the Node.js community.... ## Conclusion

Node.js is a powerful and versatile runtime environment that has revolutionized server-side programming by bringing JavaScript to the backend. Leveraging the V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js compiles code into efficient machine code, enabling high-performance execution. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model allows developers to easily build scalable and responsive applications capable of handling numerous concurrent connections.

# What Is Node.js? Complex Guide for 2023

**from Netflix and PayPal to LinkedIn**, to build fast, high-quality applications.

## Contents... ## Introduction

This guide is for anybody looking to learn more about how Node.js works, its pros and cons and how it can help deliver tangible business results.

We’ll begin by defining what Node.js is and give a brief history of its development, before listing some pros and cons, with examples to highlight them. There’ll also be some tips on

**how to host and maintain Node.js applications** and how Node.js compares with other programming languages.

So, let’s get going.

### What is Node.js and why does it matter?

Node.js is an

**open source, cross-platform runtime environment and library** that is used for running web applications outside the client’s browser.

It is used for

**server-side programming**, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.js is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Sounds a bit complicated, right?

In simple terms, what this means is that entire sites can be run using a unified ‘stack’, which makes development and maintenance quick and easy, allowing you to focus on meeting the business goals of the project.

The fact that Node.js is open source means that it is free to use and constantly being tweaked and improved by a

**global community of developers**.

An important thing to understand about Node.js is that it is actually neither a framework or a library - as with traditional application software -, but

** JavaScript a runtime environment**.

A runtime environment (sometimes shortened to RTE) contains Web API’s that a developer can access to build a code, and a JavaScript engine that parses that code. This makes it lightweight, flexible and easy to deploy, all features that will help to optimize and speed up your application project.... ### Node.js glossary

Below is a list of common terms you’ll see when reading about or discussing Node.js, and their definitions.

#### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the programming language that underpins Node.js. It is a

**high-level and multi-paradigm language** characterized by ‘curly bracket’ syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientations and first class functions.

These features mean JavaScript can convert a static webpage to an interactive one, adding features such as search boxes, embedded videos or news feed refresh tools. These are features that aim to improve user experience by encouraging intuitive engagement.

#### Node.js modules

Node.js features multiple ‘modules’ that are kept within individual contexts so they do not interfere with other modules or pollute the global scope of node.js. This is crucial for open source softwares.

A module in Node.js is a functionality - either simple or complex - which is organized into JavaScript files and reusable throughout the Node.js application. There are three types of module within Node.js:

**Core Modules, Local Modules and Third Party Modules.**

Core Modules include the

**basic, bare-bones functionalities** of Node.js. They load automatically when a node process starts and are part of Node.js’s binary distribution.

Local Modules are modules that are

**created within the Node.js application**. They include different and additional functionalities in separate files and folders to the core functionality package. Local modules can also be packaged and distributed for use by the wider Node.js community.

A third party module is

**an existing code written by a third party**, and can be imported into your Node.js application to expand or add different features and functions.... ### The Pros and Cons of Node.js

#### The Popularity of Node.js

JavaScript, which underpins Node.js, has been one of the most popular programming languages available for some time. While it has more commonly been used for front-end web development, it has also

**gained ground in different areas of application and on distinct platforms**, such as Node.js.

Even though Node.js was originally written in 2009,

**it wasn’t widely adopted until recently**. Currently, numerous successful brands have leveraged Node.js to develop both front and back-end applications, including Walmart, Netflix, Medium, LinkedIn or Groupon.

Node.js is rising in popularity for a number of reasons, which we will go through shortly. It’s also important to know that, as with every technology, there are some drawbacks which mean Node.js isn’t perfect for every project.... #### What can Node.js do and what kind of products can be built with Node.js?

Node.js is a versatile JavaScript runtime environment built upon event-driven programming that enables non-blocking I/O (Input/Output) capable of serving multiple concurrent events in a single thread. This makes Node.js fast, lightweight, scalable, and efficient in handling data-heavy and I/O-heavy workloads characteristic of several types of web applications.

**Internet of Things**

IoT (Internet of Things) is a network of devices such as sensors, beacons, actuators, and any other items embedded with electronics that enables them to send and exchange data. IoT may consist of thousands of such devices, which makes it challenging to manage requests and data streams from and between the devices.

Since 2012, Node.js has become one of the preferred solutions for enterprises and organizations seeking to develop IoT systems because it can process multiple concurrent requests and events emitted by thousands or even millions of devices on the network without seeing a decrease in speed or performance.

The avalanche of requests and data coming from IoT devices does not block Node.js servers thanks to their event-driven architecture and asynchronous processing suitable for I/O-heavy operations on the IoT network. This makes Node.js fast as an application layer between these devices and the databases that store data from them.... It also gives the developers the ability to work with modern native solutions, such as async/await and other features, which can make the development process faster. There will be no need to set up transpilers, you will use fewer third-party libraries, and have a more bulletproof stack.

That said, updating the version of Node.js you’re working with isn’t the main concern here. It rarely generates backward compatibility problems. Most issues result from using outdated open-source modules.

The application can use libraries that are not supported or maintained anymore, which, in Node.js world, will accrue technological debt pretty fast.

If you have found any outdated libraries, first of all check if they’re still actively maintained. If so, prepare a plan for an update. You have to be sure that it won’t break anything.

Check whether the app has been tested through and through – a test coverage tool will be helpful here. But what if the core library is not maintained at all? Look for alternatives, and if there aren't any, make sure that your tests have you covered, and you'll be the first one to know if something stops working.

**Dig into the roots: **If your app isn’t performing well, check the roots of the problem. Is it an architecture problem or is the machine too weak to handle it?... Alternatively, could the problem lie within the code? What you do will depend on the results of this investigation – implementing autoscaling, architecture changes, or rewriting some parts of the code.

A single universal cure doesn’t exist. But there’s one thing you should always have in your locker: a monitoring service such as NewRelic or Instana. Nothing will help you better in getting to the heart of the problem than logging the application’s behaviour.

Node.js is a great fit for many projects, but as with any technology, it can cause problems if it isn’t properly maintained. When you encounter a problem, review the code, verify the documentation, and discuss the application with an experienced team.

The vast majority of issues with Node.js applications can be detected with a code review and solved with a targeted approach.... ### Analyzing Node.js vs other programming technologies

Of course, there are lots of different technologies out there to choose from, and each one will bring something different to your project or application. To help you decide, we’ve put together a comparison of Node.js and some of the main alternatives available.

#### Node.js vs Java

Node.js is perfect for web apps, mobile apps, real-time applications (instant messaging, live chat), online gaming apps, e-commerce transaction software, and much more.

It's also a good choice if

**you're dealing with microservice architecture**, which can lay the foundation for advanced systems – bear in mind that apps like Netflix or Uber were built using Node.js.

On the other hand, Java is great for applications that are

**CPU intensive or CPU-bound**. The same goes for applications with a vast code base – since Java provides strongly typed sources, refactoring it and bug fixing will be more straightforward during its maintenance.

If your application

**uses a RDBMS** (Relational Database Management System), Java will be a great pick – it includes tools that provide multi-database support for object-relational mapping to make configuration easier when you switch to another database.

It’s possible to avoid choosing between these two by developing an application in Java and linking to it with JavaScript through an engine like Rhinorun. However, in a real-world scenario,

**using Node.js for your web application makes more sense.**

It's faster and more scalable than Java, meaning quick deployment and greater potential. It also offers top performance.

The growth of Node.js among the industry giants indicates its versatility too. Node.js is far more than an application framework – it's also used in corporate data software, rapid application modernisation projects, and IoT solutions.... ### Resources for Node.js

### 5. Node.js

**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js

**Node.js** is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.

Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.... ## History

Node.js was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about 13 years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.

Dahl criticized the limited capability of Apache HTTP Server to handle many (10,000+) concurrent connections, as well as the dominant programming paradigm of sequential programming, in which applications could block entire processes or cause the creation of multiple execution stacks for simultaneous connections.

Dahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009. Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.

In January 2010, a package manager was introduced for the Node.js environment called npm. The package manager allows programmers to publish and share Node.js packages, along with the accompanying source code, and is designed to simplify the installation, update and uninstallation of packages.

In June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js. The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011.

In January 2012, Dahl yielded management of the project to npm creator Isaac Schlueter. In January 2014, Schlueter announced that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.

In December 2014, Fedor Indutny created io.js, a fork of Node.js created because of dissatisfaction with Joyent's governance as an open-governance alternative with a separate technical committee. The goal was to enable a structure that would be more receptive to community input, including the updating of io.js with the latest Google V8 JavaScript engine releases, diverging from Node.js's approach at that time.

The Node.js Foundation, formed to reconcile Node.js and io.js under a unified banner, was announced in February 2015. The merger was realized in September 2015 with Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 combining into Node v4.0. This merge brought V8 ES6 features into Node.js and started a long-term support release cycle. By 2016, the io.js website recommended returning to Node.js and announced no further io.js releases, effectively ending the fork and solidifying the merger's success.

In 2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation.... ### Branding

The Node.js logo features a green hexagon with overlapping bands to represent the cross-platform nature of the runtime. The Rocket Turtle was chosen as the official Node.js mascot in February 2024 following a design contest.... ## Overview

Node.js allows the creation of web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of "modules" that handle various core functionalities. Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams and other core functions. Node.js's modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.

JavaScript is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS languages are available. As a result, Node.js applications can be written in CoffeeScript, Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and others.

Node.js is primarily used to build network programs such as web servers. The most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently and use callbacks to signal completion or failure).

Node.js is officially supported by Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 (and later), with Tier 2 support for SmartOS and IBM AIX and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and LTS versions are available for IBM i (AS/400). The source code may also be built on similar operating systems that are not officially supported, such as NonStop OS and Unix servers.... ### Platform architecture

Node.js enables development of fast web servers in JavaScript using event-driven programming. Developers can create scalable servers without using threading by using a simplified model that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task. Node.js connects the ease of a scripting language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming.

Node.js was built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine since it was open-sourced under the BSD license, and it contains comprehensive support for fundamental protocols such as HTTP, DNS and TCP. JavaScript's existing popularity made Node.js accessible to the web-development community.

### Industry support

There are thousands of open-source libraries for Node.js, most of which are hosted on the npm website. Multiple developer conferences and events are held that support the Node.js community, including NodeConf, Node Interactive, and Node Summit, as well as a number of regional events.

The open-source community has developed web frameworks to accelerate the development of applications. Such frameworks include Express.js, Socket.IO, Sails.js, Next.js and Meteor. Various packages have also been created for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments such as Microsoft .NET.

Modern desktop IDEs provide editing and debugging features specifically for Node.js applications. Such IDEs include Atom, Brackets, JetBrains WebStorm, Microsoft Visual Studio (with Node.js Tools for Visual Studio, or TypeScript with Node definitions), NetBeans, Nodeclipse Enide Studio (Eclipse-based) and Visual Studio Code. Some online IDEs also support Node.js, such as Codeanywhere, Eclipse Che, Cloud9 IDE and the visual flow editor in Node-RED.

Node.js is supported across a number of cloud-hosting platforms such as Jelastic, Google Cloud Platform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure Web Apps and Joyent.... ## Project governance

In 2015, various branches of the greater Node.js community began working under the vendor-neutral Node.js Foundation. The stated purpose of the organization "is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of Node.js and other related modules through an open governance model that encourages participation, technical contribution, and a framework for long-term stewardship by an ecosystem invested in Node.js' success."

The Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of the Node.js Foundation. The TSC is responsible for the core Node.js repo as well as dependent and adjacent projects. Generally the TSC delegates the administration of these projects to working groups or committees. The LTS group that manages long term supported releases is one such group. Other current groups include Website, Streams, Build, Diagnostics, i18n, Evangelism, Docker, Addon API, Benchmarking, Post-mortem, Intl, Documentation, and Testing.

In August 2017, a third of the TSC members resigned due to a dispute related to the project's code of conduct.

### 6. Node.js Getting Started Guide

**URL:** https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs

# Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking. In addition, libraries in Node.js are generally written using non-blocking paradigms. Accordingly, blocking behavior is the exception rather than the norm in Node.js.

When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.

This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.

Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.... ## An Example Node.js Application

The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:

JavaScript

```

const { createServer } = require('node:http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';

const port = 3000;

const server = createServer((req, res) => {

res.statusCode = 200;

res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');

res.end('Hello World');

});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {

console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);

});

```

To run this snippet, save it as a

`server.js` file and run

`node server.js` in your terminal.

If you use mjs version of the code, you should save it as a

`server.mjs` file and run

`node server.mjs` in your terminal.

This code first includes the Node.js

`http` module.

Node.js has a fantastic standard library, including first-class support for networking.

The

`createServer()` method of

`http` creates a new HTTP server and returns it.

The server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.

Whenever a new request is received, the

`request` event is called, providing two objects: a request (an

`http.IncomingMessage` object) and a response (an

`http.ServerResponse` object).

Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.

The first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.

The second is used to return data to the caller.

In this case with:

JavaScript

```

res.statusCode = 200;

```

we set the

`statusCode` property to

`200`, to indicate a successful response.

We set the

`Content-Type` header:

JavaScript

```

res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');

```

and we close the response, adding the content as an argument to

`end()`:

JavaScript

```

res.end('Hello World\n');

```

If you haven't already done so, download Node.js.

### 7. Node.js Overview: What is Node.js and Why It Matters

**URL:** https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/what-is-nodejs

If we talk about any application then the part with which the user is interacting is basically the frontend of our website whereas there are many things which happen in the background or in the backend of our website. Basically there are three parts of any application, one is Frontend with which the users are interacting, then comes to the backend server and backend database. For backend servers we can use NodeJS, Java, Python, etc. and for backend databases we use relational or non-relational databases.

Whenever a client requests something from the client side of the application what happens is , the request is first sent to the server and then in that server some processing or calculations goes on for the validation of the client side request and after doing all such validation a response is sent to the client side. Basically for doing all such calculations and processing , this NodeJs framework of JavaScript is used.

For running our web applications outside the client’s browser , NodeJS is basically used as an open-source and cross platform JavaScript runtime environment.For running the server side applications we use this.For building the I/O intensive applications like video streaming sites ,online chatting applications and many other applications , it is used. Many established tech giant companies and newly created start-ups are using NodeJs framework in their company.

In 2009, NodeJs was developed by a guy called Ryan Dahla and the current version of NodeJs is v16.9.0.... ## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser. Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009, and its latest iteration, version 15.14, was released in April 2021. Developers use Node.js to create server-side web applications, and it is perfect for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.

Relevant Read: What is NodeJS?

Now that we know what is Node, let's look at why it is so prevalent in web development.

## How Node.js Works

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, which compiles JavaScript into efficient machine code. Node.js operates on a single-threaded event-driven architecture, utilizing an event loop to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking.

When a client sends a request to a Node.js server, the request is added to an event queue. The event loop continuously checks this queue and processes each request. If a request involves an I/O operation, Node.js offloads it to the system kernel, which handles it asynchronously. Once the I/O operation is complete, the kernel notifies Node.js, executing the corresponding callback function.

This non-blocking I/O and event-driven model allows Node.js to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently, making it ideal for building scalable, high-performance network applications.... ## Why Do We Use NodeJs?

There are many reasons for which we prefer using NodeJs for the server side of our application, some of them are discussed in the following:

- NodeJs is built on Google Chrome’s V8 engine, and for this reason its execution time is very fast and it runs very quickly.

- There are more than 50,000 bundles available in the Node Package Manager and for that reason developers can import any of the packages any time according to their needed functionality for which a lot of time is saved.

- As NodeJs do not need to wait for an API to return data , so for building real time and data intensive web applications, it is very useful. It is totally asynchronous in nature that means it is totally non-blocking.

- The loading time for an audio or video is reduced by NodeJs because there is better synchronization of the code between the client and server for having the same code base.

- As NodeJs is open-source and it is nothing but a JavaScript framework , so for the developers who are already used to JavaScript, for them starting developing their projects with NodeJs is very easy.... ## Is Node.js a Programming Language?

Node.js is not a programming language; it is a runtime environment allowing you to execute JavaScript code on the server side, outside a web browser. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, Node.js compiles JavaScript into machine code for efficient execution. It extends JavaScript capabilities by providing additional features and libraries for server-side development, such as file system access, network communication, and asynchronous I/O operations.

While JavaScript is the programming language used with Node.js, the runtime environment provides the tools and frameworks to build scalable and high-performance server applications. Node.js’s non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for real-time applications, web servers, APIs, and more. In summary, Node.js is a robust environment that leverages JavaScript to enable server-side programming, but it is not a programming language.

## Node.js Architecture

Now that we established what is Node, let’s dig into its architecture. Node.js operates on a single-thread, allowing it to handle thousands of simultaneous event loops. Here’s a diagram, provided by Sinform.com, that best illustrates Node.js architecture.... ## Parts of Node.js

Fig: Parts of Node.js

Now, let's go through each part of Node.js to get a better understanding of the server-side platform as a whole.

### Modules

Modules are like JavaScript libraries that can be used in a Node.js application to include a set of functions. In order to include a module in a Node.js application, use the require() function with the parenthesis containing the name of the module.

Fig: Include a module in Node.js

Node.js has many modules that provide the basic functionality needed for a web application. Some of them are mentioned in this table:

Fig: Node.js modules table

### Console

The console is a module that provides a method for debugging that is similar to the basic JavaScript console provided by internet browsers. It prints messages to stdout and stderr.

Fig: Node.js console

### Cluster

Node.js is built-on on the concept of single-threaded programming. Cluster is a module that allows multi-threading by creating child processes that share the same server port and run simultaneously.

A cluster can be added to an application in the following way:

Fig: Add cluster in Node.js

### Global

Global objects in Node.js are available in all modules. These objects are functions, modules, strings, etc. Some Node.js global objects are mentioned in the table below:

Fig: Global objects table... ## Applications of Node.js

Node.js is a versatile runtime environment widely used for building various applications due to its efficiency and scalability. Here are some typical applications of Node.js:

- Web Servers: Node.js is ideal for building fast and scalable web servers that handle numerous simultaneous connections with high throughput.

- Real-Time Applications: It excels in real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming, and live collaboration tools, where real-time data updates are crucial.

- APIs and Microservices: Node.js is commonly used to create RESTful APIs and microservices, facilitating communication between services in a distributed architecture.

- Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Node.js serves and handles the backend logic for single-page applications, enhancing user experience with smooth, dynamic content updates.

- Streaming Applications: Its asynchronous nature makes Node.js suitable for data streaming applications, such as video streaming services or real-time data processing.

- Command-Line Tools: Developers use Node.js to create command-line tools and scripts that automate various tasks, leveraging its rich ecosystem of packages.

- Internet of Things (IoT): Thanks to its event-driven architecture, Node.js is used in IoT applications to handle data from numerous devices in real time.

## Who Uses NodeJs?

Well in 2025, there are 15+ popular companies who are using NodeJs .

Companies like NASA, Trello, Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn, Walmart, Uber, Twitter, Yahoo, eBay, GoDaddy etc are using NodeJs.... ## NPM: Node Package Manager

NPM is a popular Node.js package library and the jewel in the crown of the Node.js community. It has millions of downloadable libraries, organized according to specific requirements, and is the largest software registry in the world. NPM is free. These libraries are growing fast to this very day, and they strengthen the Node.js community.... ## Conclusion

Node.js is a powerful and versatile runtime environment that has revolutionized server-side programming by bringing JavaScript to the backend. Leveraging the V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js compiles code into efficient machine code, enabling high-performance execution. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model allows developers to easily build scalable and responsive applications capable of handling numerous concurrent connections. From web servers and real-time applications to APIs and IoT solutions, Node.js's robust ecosystem and rich library support make it a popular choice among developers.

In essence, Node.js extends JavaScript's capabilities beyond the browser, providing a robust platform for modern server-side development. To further enhance your development skills and broaden your expertise, consider pursuing Java Certification Training. This training can complement your knowledge of Node.js, making you a more versatile and sought-after developer in the industry.

**URL:** https://www.netguru.com/glossary/node-js

# What Is Node.js? Complex Guide for 2023

**from Netflix and PayPal to LinkedIn**, to build fast, high-quality applications.

## Contents... ## Introduction

This guide is for anybody looking to learn more about how Node.js works, its pros and cons and how it can help deliver tangible business results.

We’ll begin by defining what Node.js is and give a brief history of its development, before listing some pros and cons, with examples to highlight them. There’ll also be some tips on

**how to host and maintain Node.js applications** and how Node.js compares with other programming languages.

So, let’s get going.

### What is Node.js and why does it matter?

Node.js is an

**open source, cross-platform runtime environment and library** that is used for running web applications outside the client’s browser.

It is used for

**server-side programming**, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.js is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Sounds a bit complicated, right?

In simple terms, what this means is that entire sites can be run using a unified ‘stack’, which makes development and maintenance quick and easy, allowing you to focus on meeting the business goals of the project.

The fact that Node.js is open source means that it is free to use and constantly being tweaked and improved by a

**global community of developers**.

An important thing to understand about Node.js is that it is actually neither a framework or a library - as with traditional application software -, but

** JavaScript a runtime environment**.

A runtime environment (sometimes shortened to RTE) contains Web API’s that a developer can access to build a code, and a JavaScript engine that parses that code. This makes it lightweight, flexible and easy to deploy, all features that will help to optimize and speed up your application project.... ### Node.js glossary

Below is a list of common terms you’ll see when reading about or discussing Node.js, and their definitions.

#### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the programming language that underpins Node.js. It is a

**high-level and multi-paradigm language** characterized by ‘curly bracket’ syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientations and first class functions.

These features mean JavaScript can convert a static webpage to an interactive one, adding features such as search boxes, embedded videos or news feed refresh tools. These are features that aim to improve user experience by encouraging intuitive engagement.

#### Node.js modules

Node.js features multiple ‘modules’ that are kept within individual contexts so they do not interfere with other modules or pollute the global scope of node.js. This is crucial for open source softwares.

A module in Node.js is a functionality - either simple or complex - which is organized into JavaScript files and reusable throughout the Node.js application. There are three types of module within Node.js:

**Core Modules, Local Modules and Third Party Modules.**

Core Modules include the

**basic, bare-bones functionalities** of Node.js. They load automatically when a node process starts and are part of Node.js’s binary distribution.

Local Modules are modules that are

**created within the Node.js application**. They include different and additional functionalities in separate files and folders to the core functionality package. Local modules can also be packaged and distributed for use by the wider Node.js community.

A third party module is

**an existing code written by a third party**, and can be imported into your Node.js application to expand or add different features and functions.... ### The Pros and Cons of Node.js

#### The Popularity of Node.js

JavaScript, which underpins Node.js, has been one of the most popular programming languages available for some time. While it has more commonly been used for front-end web development, it has also

**gained ground in different areas of application and on distinct platforms**, such as Node.js.

Even though Node.js was originally written in 2009,

**it wasn’t widely adopted until recently**. Currently, numerous successful brands have leveraged Node.js to develop both front and back-end applications, including Walmart, Netflix, Medium, LinkedIn or Groupon.

Node.js is rising in popularity for a number of reasons, which we will go through shortly. It’s also important to know that, as with every technology, there are some drawbacks which mean Node.js isn’t perfect for every project.... #### What can Node.js do and what kind of products can be built with Node.js?

Node.js is a versatile JavaScript runtime environment built upon event-driven programming that enables non-blocking I/O (Input/Output) capable of serving multiple concurrent events in a single thread. This makes Node.js fast, lightweight, scalable, and efficient in handling data-heavy and I/O-heavy workloads characteristic of several types of web applications.

**Internet of Things**

IoT (Internet of Things) is a network of devices such as sensors, beacons, actuators, and any other items embedded with electronics that enables them to send and exchange data. IoT may consist of thousands of such devices, which makes it challenging to manage requests and data streams from and between the devices.

Since 2012, Node.js has become one of the preferred solutions for enterprises and organizations seeking to develop IoT systems because it can process multiple concurrent requests and events emitted by thousands or even millions of devices on the network without seeing a decrease in speed or performance.

The avalanche of requests and data coming from IoT devices does not block Node.js servers thanks to their event-driven architecture and asynchronous processing suitable for I/O-heavy operations on the IoT network. This makes Node.js fast as an application layer between these devices and the databases that store data from them.... It also gives the developers the ability to work with modern native solutions, such as async/await and other features, which can make the development process faster. There will be no need to set up transpilers, you will use fewer third-party libraries, and have a more bulletproof stack.

That said, updating the version of Node.js you’re working with isn’t the main concern here. It rarely generates backward compatibility problems. Most issues result from using outdated open-source modules.

The application can use libraries that are not supported or maintained anymore, which, in Node.js world, will accrue technological debt pretty fast.

If you have found any outdated libraries, first of all check if they’re still actively maintained. If so, prepare a plan for an update. You have to be sure that it won’t break anything.

Check whether the app has been tested through and through – a test coverage tool will be helpful here. But what if the core library is not maintained at all? Look for alternatives, and if there aren't any, make sure that your tests have you covered, and you'll be the first one to know if something stops working.

**Dig into the roots: **If your app isn’t performing well, check the roots of the problem. Is it an architecture problem or is the machine too weak to handle it?... Alternatively, could the problem lie within the code? What you do will depend on the results of this investigation – implementing autoscaling, architecture changes, or rewriting some parts of the code.

A single universal cure doesn’t exist. But there’s one thing you should always have in your locker: a monitoring service such as NewRelic or Instana. Nothing will help you better in getting to the heart of the problem than logging the application’s behaviour.

Node.js is a great fit for many projects, but as with any technology, it can cause problems if it isn’t properly maintained. When you encounter a problem, review the code, verify the documentation, and discuss the application with an experienced team.

The vast majority of issues with Node.js applications can be detected with a code review and solved with a targeted approach.... ### Analyzing Node.js vs other programming technologies

Of course, there are lots of different technologies out there to choose from, and each one will bring something different to your project or application. To help you decide, we’ve put together a comparison of Node.js and some of the main alternatives available.

#### Node.js vs Java

Node.js is perfect for web apps, mobile apps, real-time applications (instant messaging, live chat), online gaming apps, e-commerce transaction software, and much more.

It's also a good choice if

**you're dealing with microservice architecture**, which can lay the foundation for advanced systems – bear in mind that apps like Netflix or Uber were built using Node.js.

On the other hand, Java is great for applications that are

**CPU intensive or CPU-bound**. The same goes for applications with a vast code base – since Java provides strongly typed sources, refactoring it and bug fixing will be more straightforward during its maintenance.

If your application

**uses a RDBMS** (Relational Database Management System), Java will be a great pick – it includes tools that provide multi-database support for object-relational mapping to make configuration easier when you switch to another database.

It’s possible to avoid choosing between these two by developing an application in Java and linking to it with JavaScript through an engine like Rhinorun. However, in a real-world scenario,

**using Node.js for your web application makes more sense.**

It's faster and more scalable than Java, meaning quick deployment and greater potential. It also offers top performance.

The growth of Node.js among the industry giants indicates its versatility too. Node.js is far more than an application framework – it's also used in corporate data software, rapid application modernisation projects, and IoT solutions.... ### Resources for Node.js

### 9. About Node.js

**URL:** https://nodejs.org/en/about

# About Node.js®

As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.

JavaScript

```

const { createServer } = require('node:http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';

const port = 3000;

const server = createServer((req, res) => {

This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model, in which OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node.js are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks except when the I/O is performed using synchronous methods of Node.js standard library. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.js.... If some of this language is unfamiliar, there is a full article on Blocking vs. Non-Blocking.

Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's

Event Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js takes the event model a bit

further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems,

there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop.

Typically, behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script, and

at the end a server is started through a blocking call like

`EventMachine::run()`.

In Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node.js

exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior

is like browser JavaScript — the event loop is hidden from the user.

HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.

Node.js being designed without threads doesn't mean you can't take

advantage of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can be spawned

by using our

`child_process.fork()` API, and are designed to be easy to

communicate with. Built upon that same interface is the

`cluster` module,

which allows you to share sockets between processes to enable load balancing

over your cores.... ## Official Node.js Resources

### 10. Node.js

**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js

**Node.js** is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.

Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.... ## History

Node.js was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about 13 years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.

Dahl criticized the limited capability of Apache HTTP Server to handle many (10,000+) concurrent connections, as well as the dominant programming paradigm of sequential programming, in which applications could block entire processes or cause the creation of multiple execution stacks for simultaneous connections.

Dahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009. Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.

In January 2010, a package manager was introduced for the Node.js environment called npm. The package manager allows programmers to publish and share Node.js packages, along with the accompanying source code, and is designed to simplify the installation, update and uninstallation of packages.

In June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js. The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011.

In January 2012, Dahl yielded management of the project to npm creator Isaac Schlueter. In January 2014, Schlueter announced that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.

In December 2014, Fedor Indutny created io.js, a fork of Node.js created because of dissatisfaction with Joyent's governance as an open-governance alternative with a separate technical committee. The goal was to enable a structure that would be more receptive to community input, including the updating of io.js with the latest Google V8 JavaScript engine releases, diverging from Node.js's approach at that time.

The Node.js Foundation, formed to reconcile Node.js and io.js under a unified banner, was announced in February 2015. The merger was realized in September 2015 with Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 combining into Node v4.0. This merge brought V8 ES6 features into Node.js and started a long-term support release cycle. By 2016, the io.js website recommended returning to Node.js and announced no further io.js releases, effectively ending the fork and solidifying the merger's success.

In 2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation.... ### Branding

The Node.js logo features a green hexagon with overlapping bands to represent the cross-platform nature of the runtime. The Rocket Turtle was chosen as the official Node.js mascot in February 2024 following a design contest.... ## Overview

Node.js allows the creation of web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of "modules" that handle various core functionalities. Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams and other core functions. Node.js's modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.

JavaScript is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS languages are available. As a result, Node.js applications can be written in CoffeeScript, Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and others.

Node.js is primarily used to build network programs such as web servers. The most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently and use callbacks to signal completion or failure).

Node.js is officially supported by Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 (and later), with Tier 2 support for SmartOS and IBM AIX and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and LTS versions are available for IBM i (AS/400). The source code may also be built on similar operating systems that are not officially supported, such as NonStop OS and Unix servers.... ### Platform architecture

Node.js enables development of fast web servers in JavaScript using event-driven programming. Developers can create scalable servers without using threading by using a simplified model that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task. Node.js connects the ease of a scripting language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming.

Node.js was built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine since it was open-sourced under the BSD license, and it contains comprehensive support for fundamental protocols such as HTTP, DNS and TCP. JavaScript's existing popularity made Node.js accessible to the web-development community.

### Industry support

There are thousands of open-source libraries for Node.js, most of which are hosted on the npm website. Multiple developer conferences and events are held that support the Node.js community, including NodeConf, Node Interactive, and Node Summit, as well as a number of regional events.

The open-source community has developed web frameworks to accelerate the development of applications. Such frameworks include Express.js, Socket.IO, Sails.js, Next.js and Meteor. Various packages have also been created for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments such as Microsoft .NET.

Modern desktop IDEs provide editing and debugging features specifically for Node.js applications. Such IDEs include Atom, Brackets, JetBrains WebStorm, Microsoft Visual Studio (with Node.js Tools for Visual Studio, or TypeScript with Node definitions), NetBeans, Nodeclipse Enide Studio (Eclipse-based) and Visual Studio Code. Some online IDEs also support Node.js, such as Codeanywhere, Eclipse Che, Cloud9 IDE and the visual flow editor in Node-RED.

Node.js is supported across a number of cloud-hosting platforms such as Jelastic, Google Cloud Platform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure Web Apps and Joyent.... ## Project governance

In 2015, various branches of the greater Node.js community began working under the vendor-neutral Node.js Foundation. The stated purpose of the organization "is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of Node.js and other related modules through an open governance model that encourages participation, technical contribution, and a framework for long-term stewardship by an ecosystem invested in Node.js' success."

The Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of the Node.js Foundation. The TSC is responsible for the core Node.js repo as well as dependent and adjacent projects. Generally the TSC delegates the administration of these projects to working groups or committees. The LTS group that manages long term supported releases is one such group. Other current groups include Website, Streams, Build, Diagnostics, i18n, Evangelism, Docker, Addon API, Benchmarking, Post-mortem, Intl, Documentation, and Testing.

In August 2017, a third of the TSC members resigned due to a dispute related to the project's code of conduct.
